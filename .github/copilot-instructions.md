# Copilot Instructions for PythonTutorialsSD

## Project Overview
This repository contains Python tutorial scripts for learning and experimenting with Python basics. Each file is a standalone example focused on a specific concept or feature.

## Architecture & File Structure
- Each `.py` file demonstrates a single topic (e.g., variables, classes).
- No complex module structure or package boundaries; scripts are independent.
- Example files:
  - `LC_01_Variables.py`: Demonstrates variable usage and assignment.
  - `BankAccount.py`: Likely contains a class-based example for OOP concepts.

## Developer Workflows
- **No build system or test framework detected.**
- Run scripts directly using Python:
  ```powershell
  python LC_01_Variables.py
  python BankAccount.py
  ```
- No external dependencies or requirements files present.

## Coding Conventions
- Scripts are written for clarity and educational value.
- Use simple, idiomatic Python (no advanced patterns or custom frameworks).
- No project-specific naming conventions beyond descriptive filenames.

## Integration Points
- No external APIs, databases, or service integrations detected.
- No cross-file imports or shared modules; each file is self-contained.

## Guidance for AI Coding Agents
- Focus on generating clear, beginner-friendly Python code.
- When adding new examples, follow the pattern: one concept per file, descriptive filename.
- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity or dependencies.
- If expanding, create new `.py` files for each topic.

## Example: Adding a New Tutorial
To add a tutorial on lists:
1. Create `LC_02_Lists.py`.
2. Include simple, annotated examples of list creation, manipulation, and iteration.
